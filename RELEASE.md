# CY8CKIT-028-EPD shield support library
The E-ink Display Shield Board (CY8CKIT-028-EPD) has been designed such that an ultra-low-power E-ink display, sensors and a microphone can interface with PSoC MCUs.

See [README.md](README.md) for details on how to use this library.

### What's Included?
This library includes support for each of the hardware components included on the shield:

* Ultra-low-power 2.7" E-ink Display (E2271CS021)
* Motion Sensor (BMI-160)
* Temperature Sensor (NCP18XH103F03RB)
* PDM Microphone example code (SPK0838HT4HB)

### What Changed?
#### v2.0.0
* thermistor library updated to 2.0.0.
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release supporting the E-Ink display, motion sensor, and thermistor

### Supported Software and Tools
